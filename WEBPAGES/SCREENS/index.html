        <b>Starting Screen</b> <br> <br>
Our game will consist of many screens, starting with the beginning screen. This will just be the starting menu of the game that will appear upon clicking the 'game' button on our website. This screen will include the title sliding down into place, a play button to direct you to the main menu screen, and an instructions button in the bottom left corner to take you back to the instructions page.

        <b>Main Lobby Screen</b> <br> <br>
Once the players understand how to play the game, they can choose to go to the main lobby screen. The main lobby is just a screen that will have the options of the levels that the players can play. Our game will contain two playable maps, so there will be two "doors" (gems) leading to each map. The players will use their mouse to select the level of their choice.

      <b>Game Map Screens </b><br> <br>
        After selecting a level of their choice, the players will be directed to the map, where they play the game. The two images below are rough sketches of the layouts of both maps. There are also different labelled features in these sketches, such as the 'total lives', where if one of the players makes contact with an obstacle, their lives will be deducted. Then, a timer will sit in the upper right side of the screen, as the players will be timed on completing the level. There will also be colour coded gems that are designated for the corresponding players to collect, and colour coded puddles that the players will be prohibited to walk in. Finally, the doors at the end of the level will be the exits.

      <b>Leaderboard Screen</b> <br> <br>
        Once the players have completed a map, this leaderboard screen will appear. On the left side, the players names will be shown; it will display how well each player finished the level, and sort it by the time of completion (right side). It will also show how many gems each player collected.
