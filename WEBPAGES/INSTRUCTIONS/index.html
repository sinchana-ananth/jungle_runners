        Here are the instructions needed to play Jungle Runners, a two player game heavily inspired from <em>Fireboy and Watergirl</em>.

        <b>Step 1</b> <br> <br>
After clicking the game link, you will receive two prompts that will ask for the names of the players. Once you have come up with your names, type them in the text box and click 'OK'.

        <b>Step 2</b> <br> <br>
After entering your player names, the first screen you will see is the starting screen. This will include two buttons: the play button and the help button (question mark). If you do not know how to play the game, the help button will take you to this page. If you wish to proceed and know how to play, click the play button. 
      </p>

        <b>Step 3</b> <br> <br>
Here are the maps of the game. As you can see in the pictures, there are the players, gems, puddles, lives, leaves, gears, and the exit door. The controls are 'W, A, S, D' for player 1, and the arrow keys for player two. The goal of the game is to collect all of the gems corresponding to your players colour (purple or red), and making it to the end without losing all of your lives. The puddles are also colour coded; the players are allowed to walk on the puddles that match their colour, but walking on a colour that doesn't match will deduct a life. Having a player collide with a leaf or gear will also subtract a life. Remember to pay attention to the top right of the screen to see how much time you have left. The goal of the game is to collect as many gems as you can (there is a gem counter), and go to the exit door.

        <b>Purple water</b> <br> <br>
      This is purple water, and player 1 is only allowed to walk on it. If player 2 attempts to walk on it, they will lose a life.

        <b>Red water</b> <br> <br>
      This is red water, and has the same idea as purple water but reversed. Player 2 is only allowed to walk on it, and player 1 will lose a life if they try to walk on it.

Once you've completed both of the maps, this leader board will be displayed. It shows the first two characters of the players names, and shows how long it took for them to complete the map. DNF (Did Not Finish) means that the player did not finish the map in time. If you want to play the game again, click enter.
